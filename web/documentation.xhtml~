                                <strong> Overview </strong>

                                <p>
                                    The Gene Ontology (GO) is a widely popular set of terms used to annotate gene product characteristics (“functions”) 
                                    based on certain evidence. Despite ongoing changes in its design, it is considered a “gold standard” tool for analysis and 
                                    data interpretation in a variety of settings.</p> 
                                <p>
                                    Previous studies have highlighted species-specific biases in annotation properties that could potentially impact the 
                                    interpretation and reproducibility of analyses where GO was used, particularly for genet set enrichment analysis or
                                    gene function prediction. </p>
                                <p>
                                    Assessment of this impact, however, remains challenging as these changes differ between species and gene products.
                                    We extend upon the results by Gillis J and Pavlidis P. [Bioinformatics 29,4 (2013)], to analyse the historical 
                                    stability of GO annotation data in 14 different organisms, which include semantic similarity and 
                                    multifunctionality metrics, GO term membership, trends and a visualization tool (GOtrack) to visualize 
                                    those changes on a per gene and per GO term basis. This information will help the research community to 
                                    visualize how the annotation for particular genes of their interest have changed and assess its impact on their research.
                                </p>

                                <strong> Why does the GO annotations change?</strong>
                                <p> There are several reasons why the annotations change and can impact studies where GO was used.
                                    Rachael P Huntley (from EBI) has recently published a review paper describing some of these changes,
                                    which can be summarized as follows:
                                </p><p>

                                    We are considering to include some others in the future. </p>

                                <strong>Where are these annotations coming from? </strong>
                                <p>The files used for this tool come from EMBL-EBI, FlyBase, SGD, and EcoCyc, which base their annotations on 
                                    the structure of the Gene Ontology. </p>

                                <strong> How were the IDs mapped? </strong>
                                <p>
                                    To be able to trace the gene product annotations over time (from the very first edition available), the identifiers were mapped using 3 combined methods:
                                    <p> </p>
                                    1)using the mapping files provided by the <a href="ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/idmapping/by_organism/"> Uniprot website</a>, 
                                    <p></p>
                                    2)using the synonyms listed on the GOA files to find and match the missing ID with the one used in subsequent editions and <p></p>
                                    3)updating the Uniprot IDs by querying each identifiers to the Uniprot website and retrieve the latest ID version
                                     (as some of them over time are merged, updated from TrEMBL to SwissProt ID or become deprecated)                                    
                                </p>
                                <p>In addition, some old annotations were supported by publications which had Medline identifiers, those were also 
                                    upgraded to the respective Pubmed Identifier using these <a href="http://mbr.nlm.nih.gov/Download/MUIDtoPMID/index.shtml"> conversion files</a> to trace each publication supporting the annotations. 
                                </p>
                                <strong>Am I looking at genes, gene products or proteins? </strong>

                                <p>The identifiers refer to gene products, which are all mapped to one gene(as informed in the Uniprot website),including alternative 
                                    splicing variants,proteins and RNAs. This is the reason why even if the human genome has almost 23,000 genes,
                                    we can find > 50,000 identifiers. Take into account that some of them are redundant and some are automatically assigned as fragments but then removed as curation efforts progress. 

                                </p>

                                <strong>What is the semantic similarity and how is it calculated? </strong>

                                <p> Is a metric used to estimate how similar are two concepts based on a distance measurement.
                                    In this case, it is used to estimate the similiarity between annotations for the same gene product 
                                    comparing each edition versus de latest one(current). Distance was measured with the Jaccard index. 
                                    It was calculated based on the set of GO terms that
                                    are always present across all the editions and a list of the gene products that are at least 90% present
                                    across all editions. 
                                </p>
